|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

**Leaf Node**

- For i = 1, 2, ..., n–1, pointer $P_i$ points to a file record with search-key value $K_i$

- $P_n$ points to next leaf node in search-key order

**Non-Leaf Node**

- All the search-keys in the subtree to which $P_i$ points have values greater than or equal to $K_{i-1}$ and less than $K_i$ 

- All the search-keys in the subtree to which $P_n$ points have values greater than or equal to $K_{n-1}$

### Occupancy Invariant

- Each node that is not a root or a leaf has between$\lceil n/2 \rceil$ and n children.
- A leaf node has between $\lceil (n-1)/2 \rceil$ and n–1 values
- Special cases: 
    - If the root is not a leaf, it has at least 2 children.
    - If the root is a leaf (that is, there are no other nodes in the tree), it can have between 0 and (n–1) values
